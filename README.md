# BXMediaBrowserDemoApp

This macOS demo application shows how to integrate the BXMediaBrowser Swift package into you own app. This this package you can browser media files of several types (Images, Video, Audio) from various sources. Since this is still a work in progress, not everything is implemented yet. The following sources are available at the moment:

- Finder Folders
- Unsplash.com
- Apple Music.app
- Apple Photos.app (rudimentary support)

More is coming in the future.

To test browsing unsplash.com with the demo app, you need to get your own API access key and put it in your login keychain under “api_unsplash_com_accessKey”.

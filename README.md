# BXMediaBrowserDemoApp

This macOS demo application shows how to integrate the BXMediaBrowser Swift package into your own app. BXMediaBrowser is a modern successor to the popular (but aging) iMediaBrowser framework. 

With this package you can browse media files of several types (image, video, audio) from various sources. Since this is still a work in progress, not everything is implemented yet. The following sources are available at the moment:

- Finder Folders
- Unsplash.com
- Apple Music.app
- Apple Photos.app (rudimentary support)

More is coming in the future.

Click on the round + icon behind the "Folders" section in the sidebar to add top-level folders.

To test browsing unsplash.com with the demo app, you need to get your own API access key and put it in your login keychain under “api_unsplash_com_accessKey”.

If you are interested in using BXMediaBrowser or in contributing to its development, please get in touch.
